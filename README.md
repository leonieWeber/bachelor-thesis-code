# bachelor-thesis-code of Leonie Weber

This repository contains the analysis code for my bachelor thesis.

The actual analysis code is in `calcium_signal_analysis.py` and the preprocessing code is in `preprocessing.py`

The analysis is executed by
``` 
python run_preprocessing.py 
python run_analysis.py
``` 
I used Python 3.11
